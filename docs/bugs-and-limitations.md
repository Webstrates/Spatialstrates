# Known Bugs and Limitations

## Bugs

### Controller Menu Not Showing

When using Spatialstrates on the Quest 3 HMD, the controller menu does not show up initially. A workaround is to switch to hand tracking and then back to the motion controllers.


## Limitations

### Performance

Spatialstrates is a research prototype and as such not optimized for performance. Especially in scene with many elements the performance can drop on slower devices. Especially on the Meta Quest 3 and Pro, the performance is limited.


### Compatibility

We tested Spatialstrates on desktop (Windows, macOS) with a variety of browsers (Chrome, Edge, Safari), on Android using Chrome, and on the Meta Quest 3 and Pro headsets. On the Apple Vision Pro headset, WebXR does not yet support AR, but VR works with some rendering bugs.
