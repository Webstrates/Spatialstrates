# Collaboration

The Collaboration folder contains packages that enable collaboration. The User Manager allows users to create a user name that is used by the User Display and Avatar components. The former displays the a list of all users that are currently in the same space as oneself. Avatars enable awareness of others in the same spaceâ€”both in 2D, 3D, or across the two. Avatars can be toggled in the menu, as they may impact performance.
